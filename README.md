# DoubleLinkedListQueue
Implementation a double linked list queue in JavaScript


I am just starting to learn JavaScript and figured a good way to familarize myself with the new language was to make something similar to what I have made in the past with C++ (language I have the most experience with)

For stacks and queues, creating a doubly linked list implementation is not much more complex than for a singly linked list implementation. The main reason I decided to make this was to get some extra practice with closure and the module pattern in JavaScript before moving on to something a bit more complicated.

My end goal is to implement a double linked list queue that takes user input to perform the following five functions:
  1. enqueue a value
  2. dequeue a value
  3. print the entire queue (in either forward or reverse direction)
  4. search the queue for a specified value
  5. close the program

This program is intended for personal education, and I plan on updating it as I learn more concepts in JavaScript


Along with this README file, this repository contains:
  1. a JavaScript file with the entire implementation of the dll queue (DoubleLinkedListQueue.js)
  2. an html file to run said JavaScript file (DoubleLinkedListQueue.html)(I plan to expand on this when I get the chance to learn more about html)
